## Git Ignore
# Templates: https://github.com/github/gitignore


# What to ignore?
# All generated files
# package-lock.json : Typically checked in



# Patterns
# !     negate
# ?     any one character
# []    character class (ex: [a-Z] or [0-9]
# *     any character(s)
# **    matches all files or zero or more directories

# Example
# src folder: ignore generated js files
src/*.js
!src/index.js



# Once a file is being tracked by git, adding it to gitignore
# will NOT stop tracking it!
# git rm --cached

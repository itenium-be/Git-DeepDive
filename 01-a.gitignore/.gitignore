## Git Ignore

# What to ignore?
# All generated files (dll, exe, logs, test results, ...)
# There are exceptions, if unsure, Google is your friend!
# Example:
# package-lock.json : Typically checked in for CI


# Patterns
# !     negate
# ?     any one character
# []    character class (ex: [a-Z] or [0-9] or [aA])
# *     any character(s)
# **    matches all files or zero or more directories

# Example
# src folder:
# Ignore generated js files
src/*.js
# But do track index.js entrypoint
!src/index.js

# Once a file is being tracked by git,
# adding it to gitignore will NOT stop tracking it!
# git rm --cached <file(s)>



# There is also .git\info\exclude
# This is NOT pushed/shared and only works locally
